Alfresco Mobile was designed and developed by Alfresco Software, Inc. and connects to Alfresco in the cloud and Alfresco on-premise servers (3.4.8 and above) to provide safe access to your corporate files on the go. This mobile application connects to your Alfresco repository using your Alfresco login credentials (over HTTP or HTTPS), and manages access based on your permissions.

Alfresco Mobile is based on top of another open source project, the [Alfresco iOS SDK](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-ios-sdk). More information about deveoping mobile apps for Alfresco can be found on our [developer portal](http://developer.alfresco.com/mobile).
