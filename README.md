Welcome to the Alfresco iOS App
===

Alfresco is the open platform for business-critical content management and collaboration.

Alfresco Mobile was designed and developed by Alfresco Software, Inc. and connects to Alfresco in the cloud and Alfresco on-premise servers (3.4.8 and above) to provide safe access to your corporate files on the go. This mobile application connects to your Alfresco repository using your Alfresco login credentials (over HTTP or HTTPS), and manages access based on your permissions.

Alfresco Mobile is based on top of another open source project, the [Alfresco iOS SDK](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-ios-sdk). More information about developing mobile apps for Alfresco can be found on our [developer portal](http://developer.alfresco.com/mobile).


Releases
---

The `master` branch is used for development of new features so its stability can not be guaranteed. The current release is [available for download from the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/alfresco/id459242610?mt=8). 

Alternatively, use one of the [tags](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-ios-app/tags) to build from source using the latest stable version of Xcode.

Getting started
---
In order to successfully run the app we recommend you clone the repo using your git client of choice such that the AlfrescoSDK git submodule is also fetched. Git tags won't usually contain that code and you might encounter compilation errors trying to build against them.
